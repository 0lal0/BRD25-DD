### Overview

Our data analysis aims to project the performance of both the Thread of Hope (ToH) Campaign (a unique one-time effort) and the recurring End of Year (EoY) Campaign. By examining 10 years of historical campaign data, we identified peak donation periods, successful tactics, and engagement trends.
